# Overview

**Goal** 
The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on Chicago crime data 
(specifically robbery, arson, and motor vehicle theft) from 2001-2020. 

**Method** 
First I inspected and cleaned the datasets. Then, used time series to analyze annual and monthly trends and data visualization to analyze spacial trends. I used correlation matrices to identify relational trends regarding arrests proportions and income as well as arrest proportions and location. I also fit a model using time series analysis to predict future robberies in a specific neighborhood of Chicago.
